### Group/Pair Coding
Coding by yourself is generally not the norm and coding in pairs or groups can generally help. When coding on your own you'd have to think of solutions, debug or work out a problem on your own. But in a pair there can be one **driver** and one **navigator**.

This implies that one person is in charge of typing up the code and the other person can support them. The support generally comes in the form of helping with syntax, providing different views of an issue and or solution and debugging.
